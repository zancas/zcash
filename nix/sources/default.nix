# This derivation fetchs all external sources and links them in one
# output, which provides two benefits:
#
# First, it helps centralize all external source info (url & hash)
# for easy review by anyone, including those unfamiliar with nix.
#
# Second, nix doesn't yet have a "--download-only" or "--download-first"
# option. (FIXME: link to the relevant ticket). This approach allows a
# dev do have that functionality: for example, they can run `nix build
# ./nix/sources.nix` before a long no-wifi flight, then run the rest of
# the build on the flight. Also, nix builds dependencies before dependants,
# but the order isn't "leaves first", so with the more typical approach of
# `fetchurl` in each derivation, the build interleaves downloading with
# building steps. This design ensures all downloading happens early in
# the build process.
